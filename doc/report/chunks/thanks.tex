Many thanks go  to all the people  who have supported us  during our studies,
and this project in particular:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[]\emph{Friends and families}, for their patience when we were absent
        from their lives.
    \item[]\emph{Richard Gut}, for showing  much patience in explaining things
        again  and again  when our  minds proved  resistant to  digital signal
        processing insight.
    \item[]\emph{Michael Pichler}, for his support when debuggin FPGA problems.
    \item[]\emph{Hanspeter Schmid}, for his help with understanding the magic
        of CIC filters and SNR calculations.
    \item[]\emph{Hans Buchmann},  for his  avid enthusiasm  in helping  us to
        figure out device trees on GNU/Linux.
    \item[]\emph{Pavel Demin}, for his ADC core and prompt technical support
        in helping us to understand the innards of the STEMlab.
\end{itemize}
