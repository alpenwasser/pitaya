The objective  of this  project is  to realize a  system for  measuring analog
signals  in  the kilohertz  to  low  megahertz  range  with a  digital  signal
processing  system  in  real  time,  offering  an  affordable  alternative  to
expensive oscilloscopes  and spectrum  analyzers. The basic components  of the
system are a  Red Pitaya STEMlab for signal acquisition  and processing  and a
personal  computer  or  mobile  device  for  data  visualization  and  further
analysis.

To  allow transmission  over  an  Ethernet connection  and  to improve  signal
quality, the high-rate data stream coming from the STEMlab's analog-to-digital
converter  is   decimated  to  a   lower-rate  signal  using   the  integrated
FPGA. During decimation, the signal passes through one of six filter chains to
attenuate aliasing  effects. 

The chains  run on  the STEMlab's  FPGA. They are based  on a  combination of
FIR  and CIC  filters,  and  decimate the  incoming  \SI{125}{\MHz} signal  to
output frequencies  between \SI{50}{\kHz} and \SI{25}{\MHz},  depending on the
chain. They  achieve  an  aliasing  attenuation of  \SI{60}{\dB}  and  exhibit
negligible passband droop. A  signal-to-noise ratio of up  to \SI{84}{\dB} has
been measured.

The decimated signal is then passed on  to an embedded GNU/Linux and sent to a
client over  a network connection. A newly  developed oscilloscope application
allows observation  of the signal  from a  client device.  The  application is
based on JavaScript,  allowing for easy deployment across any  platform with a
modern browser available.

All components created for this project  are provided under the MIT license. A
comprehensive toolchain covering filter design, FPGA tools, embedded GNU/Linux
and front end  development, along with documentation, allows  anyone to extend
and modify the system and to tailor it to their needs.
