        [Influence of Sampling Frequency on Absolute Transition Band Width]{%
        Influence of sampling frequency on a filter's absolute transition band
        width.  Both plots depict the same filter; in the top plot it is being
        run  at \SI{2}{\MHz},  while in  the bottom  plot it  is being  run at
        \SI{1}{\MHz}. Because the \emph{relative} transition band width is the
        same in both cases ($0.1 \cdot f_s/2$), the \emph{absolute} transition
        band width is twice as large in the top plot as in the bottom plot. Or
        alternatively: The same filter can achieve a steeper passband-stopband
        transition if it  is being run at a lower  sampling frequency. This is
        why cascading  filters is often  a desirable thing  to do in  order to
        save resources.%

        Cascade  of   two  halfband   filters  with  their   transition  bands
        overlapping,  leading  to  a  spike above  the  desired  threshold  of
        \SI{-40}{\dB}  in  the  stop  band. This  configuration  is  therefore
        unsuitable.%

%
%Talking about which type of filter has which properties is all good and well in theory, but
%how does one actually apply this knowledge to a practical problem? This section answers that
%question insofar as it applies to our project.

%\begin{itemize}\tightlist
%    \item
%        limited HW resources

%        single-stage vs. multi-stage
%    \item
%        TBW issue with multi-stage
%    \item
%        filters at lower frequencies use fewer resources
