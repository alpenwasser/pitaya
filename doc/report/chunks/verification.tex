\chapter{Verification} % <<< ------------------------------------------------- %
\label{ch:verification}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

Designing  filtes in  Matlab and  running FPGA  simulations in  Vivado is  all
nice  and well,  but  in the  end,  what  counts is  how  the system  performs
in  practice. This chapter  outlines  which sorts  of  measurements have  been
performed, the rationale behind them, and summarizes the results themselves.

All  the  metrics  presented  in  this  chapter are  based  on  the  same  set
of  measurements. For each  filter  chain, \num{2000}  measurements have  been
made,  each with  a size  of  \num{8192} samples  in  the time  domain at  one
frequency. Between each of the \num{2000} runs  for a single chain, the signal
frequency  increases equidistantly  from \num{0}  to five  times the  filter's
outgoing sampling  frequency. Covering \num{2000} frequencies allows  to cover
the passband ripple and the transition band in sufficient resolution to detect
possible issues.

For the  filter chains  with $R=5$  decimators at their  ends (the  chains for
decimations by  \num{5}, \num{25}, \num{125}  and \num{625}), this  means that
the output  filter's passband  is first  traversed, and  then its  stopband up
until half its incoming sampling rate. This enables us to measure the passband
and  stopband magnitude  response. Furthermore, by  performing an  FFT of  the
filter chain's output at specific frequencies,  we can verify how strongly the
stopband aliases back into the passband. This is the problem illustrated in
Figures~\ref{fig:aliasing:iirCopies},
\ref{fig:cic:freq_responses:passband:aliasing},
and~\ref{fig:stl125:moving_averager}.

For the filter chains with half-band filters as their final stages (\num{1250}
and \num{2500}),  this frequency range is  actually too large, since  we would
only need to measure up to twice  the outgoing sampling rate in order to cover
the final filter's  magnitude response range.  However, there is  no real harm
in going higher (a bit of resolution is lost), and it simplifies the measuring
process, so no particular distinction is made here.

Note that it is generally not necessary to measure at even higher frequencies.
As can be seen in Section~\ref{sec:multi_stage_filter_designs} and some of the
frequency responses  for the filter  cascades which  are being used  (e.g. the
chain for  $R=25$, see page~\pageref{images/fdesign/chain25.tikz}), it  is the
final filter in a cascade which determines the chain's overall behavior in the
relevant frequency regions (assuming the individual filters in the chains have
been sensibly designed  to match each other's  characteristics, also explained
in  the section  \emph{\nameref{sec:multi_stage_filter_designs}}).  Increasing
the input  frequency further  simply moves  into regions  which are  ever more
strongly  attenuated, so  unless serious  issues are  encountered, the  higher
spectral  ranges are  not of  much interest  in verifying  the filter  chain's
functionality. The  measurements for  the  \num{1250}  and \num{2500}  chains,
which do indeed cover more than the necessary frequency range, confirm this.

All   measurements   are   adjusted   to   have   the   right   scaling   with
Equation~\ref{eqn:verification:transform} where $x_{unsigned}$ is the measured
sample.
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:verification:transform}
    x_{i,\mathrm{signed}} &= \left(x_{i,\mathrm{unsigned}} - 2^{15}\right) \cdot 2^{-15} \\
    x_{i,\mathrm{V}}      &= x_{i,\mathrm{signed}} \cdot \SI{1.1}{\V}
\end{align}

\section{RMS Frequency Response} % <<< --------------------------------------- %
\label{sec:verification:rms}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

To verify  that the  filters perform as  expected, the RMS  of all  samples is
calculated and  plotted against their  respective input frequency, as  seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:verification:rmsAll}.  The RMS looks  okay and the passband is
practically linear. Two things stand out as not too positive:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
    \item 
        The passband frequency  response has a slight slope  upwards. It is at
        no  point  higher  than  \SI{20}{\mV},  effectively  having  an  error
        below  \SI{2}{\percent}  in  all  of  the  filter  chains  except  the
        $R=5$  chain.  
        This is  mostly in  line with  the case in  the filter  performance as
        predicted  by  Matlab; a  ripple  in  the cascade's  passband  between
        \SI{0.67}{\percent} and \SI{2.8}{\percent} is predicted.
        What is  peculiar is that  the overall  shape of the  passband doesn't
        quite  align  with  Matlab's  designs. No  behavior  occurs  which  we
        consider to be deal-breaking though.
    \item 
        The passband of $R=5$ chain looks deformed, on the other hand, and not
        at all what  is expected. Something has gone  horribly wrong here. The
        previous statements do not apply for this case.
\end{itemize}
On the other hand, these results are as expected:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        The  Passband has  a  slight ripple  of  $\pm\SI{1}{\percent}$ in  all
        filter  chains.   chains. This  is  well  within   the  filter  design
        specification in theory.  Matlab predicts  a a ripple in the cascade's
        passband between \SI{0.67}{\percent} and \SI{2.8}{\percent}, depending
        on the chain.
    \item 
        The  passband   shows  a   gain  loss. If  the   optimum  case   of  a
        \SI{2}{\bit}  win   were  achieved,   all  of  the   amplitudes  would
        be   at  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}   =  \SI{0.707}{\V}$   (since  input   is
        \SI{2}{V_{\mathrm{PP}}}).    Since   not   all   filter   chains   win
        the   same   amount  of   bits,   this   sadly   is  not   the   case.
        Table~\ref{tab:verification:results} lists  the actual number  of bits
        won, along with  correction factors which need to be  applied to scale
        the output correctly.
\end{itemize}
Overall,  these  results  are  mostly acceptable  in  our  view,  particularly
considering that  this system is  in essence a  first prototype which  has not
gone through any performance tuning  yet. However, there is certainly room for
further investigation and improvement.

\section{Mean Frequency Response} % <<< -------------------------------------- %
\label{sec:verification:mean}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

Because it  became apparent during tests  that the device has  an offset (even
without filters!), the  mean of each sample has been  calculated too such that
at later stages  the offset can be calibrated out  in the scoping application.
The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:verification:meanAll}.

Achieving  a  good  SNR is  also  one  of  project's  goals, so  the  SNR  has
been  calculated  plotted   for  each  input  frequency  as   well,  shown  in
Figure~\ref{fig:verification:snrAll}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{images/verification/meanAll.tikz}
    \caption[Mean at Filter Outputs]{%
        The  mean  at  the  output  of  each filter  stage  over  a  range  of
        frequencies.  Since the  input signal is a sine wave  and the function
        generator which provides it has  been verified to have no (meaningful)
        offset, these lines should be located at zero volts.%
    }
    \label{fig:verification:meanAll}
\end{figure}

\section{SNR Frequency Response}
\label{sec:verification:snr}


\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{images/verification/snrAll.tikz}
    \caption[SNR at Filter Outputs]{%
        The  SNR  at  the  output  of  each  filter  stage  over  a  range  of

        expected, nor desired.%
    }
    \label{fig:verification:snrAll}
\end{figure}

Generally the  SNR looks very  promising. Compared to the measurements  of the
STEMlab's stock  configuration carried  out by  our predecessors,  the filters
have  improved: Taking  the  example  for $R=1024$  and  $f_\mathrm{signal}  =
\SI{40}{\kHz}$, Table~\ref{tab:stl125:measurements_bucher_kuery}  gives an SNR
of \SI{76.4}{\dB}, while Matlab computes an SNR of \SI{78.1}{\dB} for $R=1250$
and the  same frequency in  our system. This  result and comparison  does come
with some caveats, however:
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
    \item
        The   measurement  methodology   between  the   two  results   is  not
        the   same. The   first   result   was    acquired   by   way   of   a
        \SI{50}{\ohm}-terminated separate reference  measurement for the noise
        floor instead of extracting it  from the measured signal, which Matlab
        does.

        Unfortunately, the function generator has  some strong harmonics and a
        non-negligible noise floor itself, and sometimes Matlab fails to catch
        all  the signal  components which  should be  discarded for  the noise
        floor  RMS  calculation. This can  lead  to  errors and  artefacts  in
        Matlab's SNR calculations.
    \item
        Experience  has shown  that the  latter method  yields an  SNR several
        decibels worse than the former method.
    \item
        In  conclusion, we  are confident  that  we have  actually achieved  a
        higher improvement over the stock configuration than these two numbers
        would indicate.
\end{itemize}
Of course, we could also perform \SI{50}{\ohm} reference measurements, extract
the peaks  from the measured signals,  and then calculate RMS  via integrating
the power density of both. However, automating this process for a large set of
data  points  has not  been  feasible  within  the  time constraints  of  this
project. For  assessing  the overall  performance  of  our filter  chains,  we
consider collecting a large data set across the frequency axis more meaningful
than  than  manually  performing  measurements  for  a  small  set  of  single
frequencies, which is why we have chosen a different methodology.

Another  point which  needs to  be addressed  are the  downward spikes  in the
passband.  At the  moment, their cause is not yet  clear. We suspect that they
are caused by the harmonic distortion of the function generator which has been
used. However,  this  might not  be  the  sole cause  (if  at  all), and  more
investigation is  required.  Comparing with  a dedicated spectrum  analyzer is
certainly also advisable.

\section{Stopband Attenuation} % <<< ----------------------------------------- %
\label{sec:verification:snr}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

Measuring stopband attenuation  is relevant in order to verify  whether or not
an the aliasing  effect of the stopband into the  passband during downsampling
is attenuated to the specified degree of \SI{60}{\dB}. See
Figures~\ref{fig:aliasing:iirCopies},
\ref{fig:cic:freq_responses:passband:aliasing}
and~\ref{fig:stl125:moving_averager} for illustrations of the phenomenon.

For this purpose,  the power density spectrum is plotted
properly scaled and adjusted  as seen in Equation~\ref{eqn:verification:power}
through~\ref{eqn:verification:power_density}. 
Figures~\ref{fig:verification:fB5}  through \ref{fig:verification:fB5}  depict
the results. Each plot  contains one frequency which falls  into the passband,
one which falls into the filter's edge, and one which falls into the stopband.

The passband and edge frequency components  are expected to be relatively high
(depending  on where  exactly in  the edge  the measurement  point falls). The
measurement point  in the stopband  should be \SI{60}{\dB} below  the passband
measurement point, however. Most satisfactorily,  the measurement results line
up very nicely with the specifications.

\begin{align}
    x_{i,\mathrm{corrected}} &= x_{i,\mathrm{V}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2f_s N}} \label{eqn:verification:power} \\
    X                        &= FFT\left(x_{i,\mathrm{corrected}}\right)       \\
    X_{i,\mathrm{one}}       &= X_i \cdot 2, i < \frac{N}{2}+1                 \\
    X_{i,\mathrm{abs}}       &= |X_{i,\mathrm{one}}|                           \\
    S_{\si{\dB}}             &= 10\log_{10}(X_{i,\mathrm{abs}}^2)              \label{eqn:verification:power_density}

\section{Summary} % <<< ------------------------------------------------------ %
\label{sec:verification:summary}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

In  conclusion, the  filter  chains  perform their  task  mostly according  to
specifications, and overall we consider the  design to be a success. There are
a few points of concern though, such  as the passband droop in $R=5$ chain RMS
frequency response, and the anomalies in the SNR values in the passbands.

Certainly, more  investigating is  needed to determine  the cause(s)  of these
anomalies, and overall  performance could be tuned further. But  since this is
the  first implementation  of our  design, the  results are  considered mostly
satisfactory.

Table\ref{tab:verification:results}  lists  the   resulting  mean  values  for
comparison. \emph{SNR  won} is  the theoretical  SNR gain  caused by  the bits
which are gained  along the processing chain. It is not  the actually achieved
improvement in SNR as other factors  play a role as well. \emph{Correction} is
the  correction factor  which needs  to  be applied  in order  to achieve  the
proper gain  (\SI{0.707}{\volt} RMS  for a \SI{2}{\V_\mathrm{PP}}  signal, see
Section~\ref{sec:verification:rms}).
