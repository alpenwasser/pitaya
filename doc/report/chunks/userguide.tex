Initializing the system and using  the oscilloscope is mostly straightforward,
even for  beginners. A few notes  on the initial  setup and the  GUI's overall
concept are outlined here to get the reader started. The oscilloscope has been
designed with high discoverability of its functionality in mind, so a complete
guide on every single  last button and menu is considered  beyond the scope of
this document.

Getting the system  up and running requires two  basic steps: Initializing the
STEMlab  itself,  and  connecting  to  it  from  a  web  browser  to  run  the
oscilloscope.  Assuming the  STEMlab board at hand has been  delivered with an
SD  card containing  the  correct Linux  image from  this  project, the procedure
for this is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
        Insert the SD card coming with the board (NOTE: Check that the SD card
        has the right side up to make pin contact).
    \item 
        Connect the board physically to the network.
    \item 
        Connect the board to the power supply.
    \item 
        Call    the    board's    IP    address    and    the    right    port
        (eg.    \code{https://10.84.130.54:50090})    in    a    browser    of
        your   preference   (for   best    results   use   Chrome   61.0   and
        above). Figure~\ref{fig:userguide:url} shows  an example  how to
        do this.
    \item   A  notice   that  a   popup   has  been   blocked  should   appear
        (Figure~\ref{fig:userguide:popup:warn}). Select   \emph{Always   allow
        popups from  this application.} or  similar and reload  the previously
        called   page. Figure~\ref{fig:userguide:popup:yes}  illustrates   the
        necessary setting.
    \item A popup  tab should now contain the scope  and automatically connect
        to the STEMlab's webserver. Figure~\ref{fig:userguide:running} shows a
        running scope.
\end{enumerate}

If it  is unknown  wether the  SD card  was delivered  with a  prebuilt image,
it  can  be  assumed  that  it  was  and  the  board  can  be  powered  on. If
the  LED  farthest away  from  the  ports (RJ45,  SD  card,  \ldots )  flashes
orange  with \SI{2}{\Hz},  the SD  card  is fine.   If  the SD  card does  not
contain a  prebuilt image,  Section~\ref{sec:devguide:fpga_toolchain:linux} in
the Developer's Guide explains how one can be acquired or built.
