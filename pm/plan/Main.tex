\section{Filter Design}
\label{sec:filters}

Contains the  work packages  relating to  filter design  in Matlab  and filter
implementation in the FPGA tool chain.

\subsection{Filter Research}
\label{subsec:filter:research}

\wpac

     {None}
     {}
     {Raphael Frey}
     {%
         Research digital the filter technologies which will be needed for this
         project. In particular, this includes FIR and CIC filters, since Xilinx
         provide predefined blocks for these filters in their toolchain.

         Besides the general knowledge on digital filters, the Xilinx toolchain
         must be researched in order to understand the FIR and CIC filter blocks
         and allow their usage.
     }

\subsection{Matlab Scripts for Filter Design}
\label{subsec:filter:matlab}

\wpac
     {}
     {}
     {}
     {None}
     {}
     {Raphael Frey}
     {%
         Matlab scripts which design various filter chains. These consist of one
         or several dispatcher scripts where the filter chains are specified in
         terms of their frequency band properties, and scripts which actually
         design the filters according to these specifications.

         Specifically, scripts for generating CIC filters and their compensation
         filters, as well as FIR filters are needed. For FIR filters, the resulting
         coefficients are to be saved in files so that they can be loaded by the
         Xilinx tool chain.

         If possible Matlab's parallelism should be exploited to reduce filter
         design times.
     }

\subsection{TCL Scripts for Filter Evaluation}
\label{subsec:filter:tcl}

\wpac
     {}
     {}

     {None}
     {}
     {Raphael Frey}
     {%
        In order to assess the resource usage of the filter chains which are
        designed by Matlab, the respective filter blocks (CIC, FIR) need to be
        implemented in Vivado and a bitstream must be compiled.

        Since the number of filters generated by package~\ref{sec:filter:matlab}
        can be very large (dozens or even hundreds), this process must be automated
        to be of any use. For this, TCL scripts are used.

        For FIR filters, the scripts load the coefficient files which have been
        generated by Matlab.

        Vivado will  generate usage  reports which  can then  be automatically
        post-processed.

         a  person  who wishes  to  compile  a  new bitstream  with  different
         filters.

\subsubsection{Techology Research}
\label{subsec:frontend:}

     {Noah H端sser}
     {%
         Research the possibilities to design and implement a nice frontend for the RedPitaya recording system.
         The RedPitaya Project has a built-in webinterface which allows the display of signals and rudimentary calculations.
         Furthermore Prof. Gut has implemented a spectrum analyzer in Java which interfaces with the RedPitaya.
         Both approaches are feasible and should be evaluated properly.
         Furthermore it has to be evaluated how the data should be transferred to the frontend.
         This descision correlates a lot with the selection of a programming language since e.g. web technologies do not support UDP.
         Finally, existing libraries have to examined very carefully. There is a lot of libraries around data transmission and GUI design, but not all of them are feasible.
     }

\subsubsection{Implementation of a basic Plotter}
\label{subsec:frontend:}
\wpac

         At first a simple plotter will be implemented. It should not do more than plot a given vector of data points on a canvas.
         The plotting should be done performantly at 60 frames per second not being dependant on the size of the data vector.
         Of course more data will slow down the plotting, but it should perform so well that the size of vectors up to 64 kilosamples do plot nicely.
         For this task it is recommended to use existing libraries which make use of the GPU such as OpenGL.
     }

\subsubsection{Implementation of a basic Receiver}

     {%
         A simple receiver which receives recorded samples over the network should be created.
         For this task a simple emmitter which emmits test samples without actually recording anything should be implemented.
         In further tasks it can be used conveniently without the need of a running RedPitaya board.
         The receiver should simply receive samples as packets with lengths of powers of two over the network.
         Again, a good, performant and publicly accepted library should be used to reduce workload and ensure reliability.

         The GUI should not only plot a qualitatively correct signal but also show it's quantities.
         A grid should be programmed into the GUI which can be used to read metrics of a signal. A panel on the GUI should display the current grid size.
         It should be possible to scale signals using the mouse or the GUI. Grids should adjust with the current scale.
     }

\subsubsection{Implement Trigger Modes}

         It should be possible to use the scope application in \textit{normal}, \textit{auto}, and \textit{single} mode.
         Those modes do as follows:
         \begin{tabular}{l l}
            \textit{normal} & the server sends a packet when a trigger was fired and repeats this procedure \\
            \textit{auto} & the server sends a packet when a trigger was fired or a timeout has been hit and repeats this procedure \\
            \textit{single} & the server sends a packet after a first trigger and does not repeat this procedure
