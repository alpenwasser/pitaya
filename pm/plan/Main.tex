\chapter{Initial Situation} % <<< ------------------------------------------------ %
\label{ch:initial}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

To replace common lab tools which are usually expensive and big Red Pitaya produces a board called STEMlab which features a capable (125$\frac{MS}{s}$, 14bit) ADC and a ZYNQ SoC from Xilinx. The idea is to record data on the board and transmit it using the network infrastructure to a PC which does all the number crunching.

To reduce data load, downsampling filter can be activated to decimate the signal. The filter is necessary such that the Nyquist theorem is fulfilled and no aliasing happens. Sadly the stock filters are not quite as capable as desired, as they do not attenuate the stopband well enough and have a frequency response not as flat as desired.

A previous project implemented new filter chains which based on IIR filters. Whilst those designed filter chains worked well in theory they did not so much in practice.

This project aims to anlyze the previous work with respect to design and implementation of those filter chains, reproduce and fix the problems that exist to date.

The structure of the idea behind the STEMlab can be seen in Figure~\label{fig:system}

        project. In particular, this includes FIR and CIC filters, since Xilinx
        provide predefined blocks for these filters in their toolchain.

        Besides the general knowledge on digital filters, the Xilinx toolchain
        must be researched in order to understand the FIR and CIC filter blocks
        and allow their usage.

        Matlab scripts which design various filter chains. These consist of one
        or several dispatcher scripts where the filter chains are specified in
        terms of their frequency band properties, and scripts which actually
        design the filters according to these specifications.

        Specifically, scripts for generating CIC filters and their compensation
        filters, as well as FIR filters are needed. For FIR filters, the resulting
        coefficients are to be saved in files so that they can be loaded by the
        Xilinx tool chain.

        If possible Matlab's parallelism should be exploited to reduce filter
        design times.

    In order to assess the resource usage of the filter chains which are
    designed by Matlab, the respective filter blocks (CIC, FIR) need to be
    implemented in Vivado and a bitstream must be compiled.

    Since the number of filters generated by package~\ref{subsec:filter:matlab}
    can be very large (dozens or even hundreds of filters), this process must be automated
    to be of any use. For this, TCL scripts are used.

    For FIR filters, the scripts load the coefficient files which have been
    generated by Matlab.

    Vivado will  generate usage  reports which  can then  be automatically
    post-processed.
