\chapter{Initial Situation} % <<< ------------------------------------------------ %
\label{ch:initial}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

To replace  common lab tools which  are usually expensive and  big, Red Pitaya
produces a board  called STEMlab which features  a capable (125$\frac{MS}{s}$,
14bit) ADC and a ZYNQ SoC from Xilinx. The idea is to record data on the board
and transmit it  using the network infrastructure  to a PC which  does all the
number crunching.

To  reduce the  data rate  and processing  load, downsampling  filters can  be
enabled to decimate the signal. The filters are necessary in order to keep the
Nyquist theorem is fulfilled and to prevent aliasing. Sadly, the stock filters
are not  quite as capable  as desired, as they  do not attenuate  the stopband
well enough and have a frequency response not as flat as desired.

A  previous project  implemented  new filter  chains which  are  based on  IIR
filters. While those  filter chains worked  well in theory (i.e.  their design
was  fundamentally  sound),  they  did not  produce  satisfactory  results  in
practice.

This project  aims to  analyze the  previous work with  respect to  design and
implementation of those  filter chains, and to reproduce and  fix the problems
that exist in the earlier solution.

The   structure  of   the   idea   behind  the   STEMlab   can   be  seen   in
Figure~\ref{fig:system}.

\chapter{Concept (revised)} % <<< ------------------------------------------------ %
\label{ch:concept}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

\section{Toolbox (revised)}

Since it has become  apparent that the STEMlab project base  led by Red Pitaya
is going through a major overhaul and it is uncertain whether this will change
in the future, we will develop our own toolbox.

We will implement a  toolchain that can build an ARM Linux  image with all the
necessary  components. This will  be done  based  on the  original Red  Pitaya
patches to  make the Linux  run on  the ZYNQ and  some scripts of  Open Source
projects which we will adapt to our needs and a more general toolchain.

We will use  GNU/Linux as a Platform  and Matlab and Vivado  for filter design
and implementation, respectively.

For  the  JavaScript  Application  we  will  use  node.js,  yarn,  rollup  and
mithril.js for the implementation.

\section{Realization (revised)}

The  preceding project  implemented filter  systems by  cascading several  IIR
filters.  While IIR filters tend to use fewer resources for a given transition
band width than FIR  filters, it still turned out that  resource usage was too
high to implement filter cascades for both channels present on the STEMlab.

Consequently, the  decision was made to  exploit CIC filters in  this project.
They are very computationally efficient and can be used as initial stages in a
filter cascade,  followed by FIR  filters to  shape the passband  response and
clean  up any  undesired  effects  which may  have  been  introduced into  the
frequency response of the system. Two types  of CIC filters are used: One with
a  decimation ratio  of  \num{25},  and another  with  a  decimation ratio  of
\num{125}.  Both are then followed by their respective compensation FIR filter
and more FIR filters for the final rate reduction.

As it has  been decided to develop an entirely  self-dependent solution of the
project, general components  on the FPGA such  as an ADC controller  or a data
logger are required. For the ADC part an  IP from Pavel Demin will be utilized
(see the project  report for further remarks and source). For  the logger part
an IP core that Mr. Hüsser developed in a previous project will be used.

For the ARM Core, a Linux will be  set up that can communicate with the logger
core via  a GNU/Linux kernel  module. A server application will  be developed
which will run on the Linux to send  the data written to the RAM by the logger
to the network. This will be done using WebSockets.

The    oscilloscope    web    application   will    be    implemented    using
JavaScript. WebSockets are used  to transmit and receive data to  and from the
network.  As build systems, yarn and rollup will be used. To implement the GUI
side of the application, mithril.js will be deployed.

\section{Testing}

To test the performance of the filters, a series of tests will be performed.

The following metrics will be calculated from the measured data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The RMS frequency response
    \item The SNR frequency response
    \item The attenuation in the stopband
\end{itemize}

Optional testing would involve a comparison to the reference implementation and to a commercial spectrum analyzer.

        which actually design the filters according to these specifications.

        Specifically,   scripts  for   generating   CIC   filters  and   their
        compensation  filters, as  well  as FIR  filters  are needed. For  FIR
        filters, the resulting  coefficients are to be saved in  files so that

        If possible, Matlab's parallelism should be exploited to reduce filter

    Since       the      number       of       filters      generated       by
    package~\ref{subsec:filter:matlab}  can  be  very large  (dozens  or  even
    hundreds of filters), this process must be automated to be of any use. For
    this, Tcl scripts are used.

    For FIR  filters, the scripts load  the coefficient files which  have been
    generated by Matlab.  Vivado will generate usage reports which can then be

        This decision  correlates a  lot with the  selection of  a programming
        language since e.g. web technologies do not support UDP.
        Finally, existing libraries have to examined very carefully. There are
        a lot  of libraries around data  transmission and GUI design,  but not
        all of them are viable solutions.

        At first a  simple plotter is implemented. It should  not do more
        than plot a given vector of data points on a canvas.
        The plotting  should be done  with high  performance at 60  frames per
        second independently of the size of the data vector.
        Of course more data will slow down the plotting, but it should perform
        well enough that vectors up to 64 kilosamples in size plot nicely.
        For this task  it is recommended to use existing  libraries which make
        use of the GPU such as OpenGL.

        A simple receiver which receives recorded samples over the network should be created.
        For  this task  a simple  emitter which  emits test  samples without
        actually recording anything should be implemented.
        In further  tasks it can  be used conveniently  without the need  of a
        running STEMlab board.
        The receiver should simply receive  samples as packets with lengths of
        powers of two over the network.
        Again, a  good, high-performance and publicly  accepted library should
        be used to reduce workload and ensure reliability.

        GUI should  display the current grid  size.  It should be  possible to
