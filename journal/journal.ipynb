However, the plot is not normalized to the sampling frequency, but is instead plotted up to half the system frequency, which amounts to 62.5 MHz. Since the filter chain before the H51 filter has a decimation ratio of 125 in this example (with 625 being the global decimation ratio, and H51 being responsible for one fifth of that), we should scale the horizontal axis accordingly to a maximum value of 500 kHz (125 MHz / 125 / 2). But because we are lazy, we will instead just scale our values as needed so that we can read the correct values off the incorrectly scaled plot.\n",

    "The input signal has a frequency of 1 kHz, which is 1/500th of 500 kHz. So, on the plot which is scaled to 62.5 MHz, the value corresponding to our input frequency should be at 1/500th of 62.5 MHz, which comes to 125 kHz.

    "### Vivado\n",
    "Vivado is the IDE Xilinx provides to write firmware for their FPGAs. It comes in a free WebPack edition and licensed ones which contain more functionality. For our more or less general purpose the free edition features suffice, even tho we got a licensed version form IME (our institute). It has an Editor to write VHDL/Verilog to describe the FPGA functionality just like you might know it. The editor feels very clunky and isn't really nice to work with. It is no problem at all to use your own editor to edit your VHDL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vivado also contains a Simulator to test your designs. It is decent and is based on the old ISE (Old Xilinx IDE) Simulator.\n",
    "I will later on, when I am into simulating pieces of hardware, write more about this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The really nice part about Vivado is the ability to script everything in TCL. Whilst I do not like TCL it is okay to interface Vivado. Litterally __everything__ can be interfaced through TCL.\n",
    "The very generous Pavel Demin wrote some TCL scripts and Anton Potocnik did some nice tutorial series with them. We are basing on them and extend them to our use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even tho Vivado can be interfaced without running the GUI once, we are executing TCL scrips from within Vivado. And the reason why we do so brings us to the next plus of Vivado:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imaging complex block structures and configuring proprietary hardware with litterally thousands of options is very hard. Luckily Vivado is your friend in that case: It has a really nice graphical representation display of all the blocks used in a project. Arranging them is a little clunky, but vivado tries it's best to rearange them themselves after adding new components and/or connections. Added cores with extended functionality and the configuration of the ZYNQ Core (to configure features like external DDR3 RAM or the AXI Bus Interfaces) can be done by double-clicking a core and browse through the options. It is a really nice way to browse and discover unknown features and all the possible options.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the best thing about all of this: Whenever you add a component, draw a connection or edit a core, Vivado outputs the used TCL command in the console so you can conveniently and procedurally recreate the action and in the future add it directly to the TCL script! Awesome!\n",
    "\n",
    "So to sum up: In our project we are going to create a _project_ and _block design_ using [Vivado TCL commands](https://github.com/alpenwasser/pitaya/blob/master/resources/ug835-vivado-tcl-commands.pdf). Editing VHDL will be done in an external editor of choice. Whilst __emacs__ has one of the best and most advanced VHDL plugins, some might prefer __Sigasi__ a free/paid plugin for Eclipse and I prefer __VS Code__, a general purpose Editor.\n",
    "Simulations will be done using Vivado.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scripting in TCL with Vivado\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the official [Vivado Scripting Guide](https://github.com/alpenwasser/pitaya/blob/master/resources/ug894-vivado-tcl-scripting.pdf) and the [article](http://eliaskousk.teamdac.com/entry/automation-of-vivado-with-tcl-week-3-of-gsoc-2016) from Elias Kousk can be seen as a good intro to scripting Vivado. Most of the topics contents are still unknown to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "To have a nice reference to TCl in general, the official references are quite good!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General TCL\n",
    "\n",
    "In TCL an entered command is seen as a $\\lambda$-expression. So the first argument entered is the procedure and the following ones are the arguments to that procedure.\n",
    "TCL has a so called substitution phase. In that phase names with a prefixed \\$-sign are replaced by their value.\n",
    "To have a concept of string-like, in TCL arguments can be grouped with `\"\"`. The substitution phase applies for contents of `\"\"` as well. If the substitution phase should not apply, `{}` can be used for grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain in an example have a look at the following\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Assigns 'value' to var\n",
    "    set var value\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Outputs '\\$var'\n",
    "    puts {\\$var}\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Outputs 'value'\n",
    "    puts \"\\$var\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "If a procedure should be evaluated inline, `[]` can be used to group it's arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "    # An example pulled from the tcl docs\n",
    "    puts [readsensor [selectsensor]]\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Interfacing Vivado\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically every command can be directly entered into the Vivado __TCL Console__. For convenience scripts can be executed using the `source` command\n",
    "\n",
    "    source script.tcl\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    source ./script.tcl\n",
    "    \n",
    "To create a new project we first need to know what XILINX Product we are using.\n",
    "We remember it as variable `part_name`. This can be done with the command\n",
    "    \n",
    "    set part_name xc7z010clg400-1\n",
    "    \n",

    "### The AXI Bus\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable AMBA AXI Bus is an on chip interconnect bus, specified by ARM. It enables the FPGA to \"speak\" with the ARM Core A9. There is option for memeory mapped IO (MMIO) or streaming between components. The AXI has a lot of features which are way too advanced for our scope. But we are going to use the AXI-Lite bus and the AXI-Stream bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically a AXI bus consists of data lanes (up to 128 Bit) and some control signals. The AXI-Lite a MMIO interface and is kinda advanced in comparison to the AXI-Stream interface and how it exactly works. Details can be read in the spec.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AXI-Stream interface has just two mandatory signals: `tdata` and `tvalid`. Technically even only `tvalid` is required.\n",
    "In our example we are going to define new component that defines an AXI-Stream interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that we create a normal VHDL module. No special requirements have to be met other than the module actually implementing an AXI-Stream \"speaking\" logic and a `tdata` and a `tvalid` signal. Those signals don't even have to be named like that, we can map them to the corresponding signals later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The module could look like\n",
    "\n",
    "```vhdl\n",
    "entity axis_to_data_lanes is\n",
    "port (\n",
    "  AxiTDataxDI: in std_logic_vector(13 downto 0);\n",
    "  AxiTValid: in std_logic;\n",
    "  DataClkxCI: in std_logic;\n",
    "  DataRstxRBI: in std_logic;\n",
    "  DataxDO: out std_logic(13 downto 0);\n",
    "  DataStrobexDO: out std_logic;\n",
    "  DataClkxCO: out std_logic\n",
    ");\n",
    "end axis_to_data_lanes;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One can easily see that the module also has a reset and clock in. Both are required for AXI too of course but are actually not part of the AXI interface itself but throught the clock and reset interfaces.\n",
    "After the actual module has been created, Vivado somehow has to be told which signals actually belong to the AXI bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we define a new AXI-Stream interface\n",
    "\n",
    "```tcl\n",
    "ipx::add_bus_interface $interface_identifier [ipx::current_core]\n",
    "set_property abstraction_type_vlnv xilinx.com:interface:axis_rtl:1.0 [ipx::get_bus_interfaces $interface_identifier -of_objects [ipx::current_core]]\n",
    "set_property bus_type_vlnv xilinx.com:interface:axis:1.0 [ipx::get_bus_interfaces $interface_identifier -of_objects [ipx::current_core]]\n",

    "set_property description $interface_description [ipx::get_bus_interfaces $interface_identifier -of_objects [ipx::current_core]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the interface has been added, ports have to be assigned to it and mapped to an AXI signal. This can be done like\n",
    "\n",
    "```tcl\n",
    "# Define new port TDATA\n",
    "ipx::add_port_map TDATA [ipx::get_bus_interfaces $interface_identifier -of_objects [ipx::current_core]]\n",
    "set_property physical_name AxiTDataxDI [ipx::get_port_maps TDATA -of_objects [ipx::get_bus_interfaces $interface_identifier -of_objects [ipx::current_core]]]\n",

    "# Define new port TVALID\n",
    "ipx::add_port_map TVALID [ipx::get_bus_interfaces $interface_identifier -of_objects [ipx::current_core]]\n",
    "set_property physical_name AxiTValid [ipx::get_port_maps TVALID -of_objects [ipx::get_bus_interfaces $interface_identifier -of_objects [ipx::current_core]]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, VHDL port names don't matter as they can easily be remapped.\n",
    "Ports could also be auto assigned by properly naming them but I don't like the automagic and weird signal names in VHDL, so I rather do it the manual but obvious way.\n",
    "Clock and Reset interfaces are done analogous. What properties they can contain can easily be seen by adding them in Vivado and observe the TCL commands printed to the console and the TCL command reference guide provided by Xilinx.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The device tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so we got the hardware part done. But how does the Arm Core A9 actually get data from the hardware?\n",
    "This can easily be done using `/dev/mem` on Linux. But this approach is kinda opaque and not really safe.\n",
    "So a better but way harder and more complicated approach is to write a kernel module.\n",
    "How a kernel module is explained another day. What should be explained here is how the device tree works.\n",
    "Linux needs a way to figure which module should be loaded for what piece of hardware. That's why there is the device tree.\n",
    "The device tree is a data structure that is loaded at boot and tells the Linux what driver should be loaded and what memory region and interrupts it's responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the device tree is structured is pretty well explained by the [Xillybus](http://xillybus.com/tutorials/device-tree-zynq-3) team. Also the [Android](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/msm/+/android-msm-hammerhead-3.4-kk-r1/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/memory.txt) sources can provide some insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xilinx already provides a __.dtsi__ for the ZYNQ7. A .dtsi is basically an include file to a .dts. Also the Linux, provided by Pavel Demin, which we are going to use already features a basic __dts.__ (the Device Tree Source file). So we just have to insert our piece of the tree that maps our AXI-Lite MMIO interface in the device tree and loads the kernel module for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ZYNQ Logger it looks like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```dts\n",
    "/* ZYNQ Logger */\n",
    "zynq_logger0: zynq_logger@43c40000 {\n",
    "    compatible = \"zynq_logger\";\n",
    "    reg = <0x43c40000 0x00010000>; /* use 64kByte addess space for the core's registers */\n",
    "    /* configure which interrupt line is used */\n",
    "    interrupt-parent = <&intc>;\n",
    "    interrupts = <0 31 4>;  // 29: F2P[0]\n",
    "    /* add more parameters here as needed */\n",
    "};\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's do a little calculation.\n",
    "Assuming we record at the possible 125MS/s, recording Data for one second on 2 channels, that would be 250MS/s. Now we have to consider that the adc data is actually 14 bits which gets ceiled to 16 bits, that's again times 2. Leading us to 500MB/s.\n",
    "Knowing that a Linux that wont instantly lag upon confronting it with small load should have 256MB at disposal, we could record half a second of data.\n",
    "Now one could say: well yeah but you could stream the data to a faster machine, right?\n",
    "Assuming we have 500MB/s, that is 4Gb/s. The Red Pitaya has 1Gb/s Ethernet like every normal PC. So instantly forget about streaming the data to another machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes we only require data rates of let's say 48kHz at a maximum. That would result in 192kB/s. So for a whopping 5 minutes of audio, we would need $48 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 60 = 57.6$MB! That's already 10% of our __total__ amount of RAM!\n",
    "Luckily this can easily be streamed to a PC. So the Server/Scope will have to feature streaming."
