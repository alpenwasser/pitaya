    "The FHNW IME has a nice Linux infrastructure. Since it makes all the necessairy environments to work with HDL and associated tools very easy we are going to use this environment instead of setting up our own.\n",

    "This command will tell you a <port> which has to be remembered. The `vncserver` command always lists ports for open sessions. In your VNC client the IME servername and port have to be entered.\n",

    "The first time you open a VNC session you will be prompted to choose a <vnc password>. This is your password when you login to VNC. Not your regular FHNW password!\n",

    "\n",
    "The above picture depicts the frequency response of the H51 filter. However, the plot is not normalized to the sampling frequency, but is instead plotted up to half the system frequency, which amounts to 62.5 MHz. Since the filter chain before the H51 filter has a decimation ratio of 125 in this example (with 625 being the global decimation ratio, and H51 being responsible for one fifth of that), we should scale the horizontal axis accordingly to a maximum value of 500 kHz (125 MHz / 125 / 2). But because we are lazy, we will instead just scale our values as needed so that we can read the correct values off the incorrectly scaled plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input signal has a frequency of 1 kHz, which is 1/500th of 500 kHz. So, on the plot which is scaled to 62.5 MHz, the value corresponding to our input frequency should be at 1/500th of 62.5 MHz, which comes to 125 kHz. The below picture is the small segment of the above plot around that frequency.\n",

    "\n",
    "As can be seen, the frequency response has an attenuation of 1 dB at this frequency, which is quite accurately 0.89. We therefore conclude that this is the reason why the H51 filter causes roughly 10% signal amplitude loss.\n",
