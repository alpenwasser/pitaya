4-Stage Cascade
===============

Results from Matlab's `freqz` for a four-stage filter cascade.
The filter itself is useless (just a proof-of-concept), but I'm
committing this because the plot in `pgfplots` has the phase going
from right to left instead of left to right (reference: `fvtool`).

TODO
====

Fix direction of phase plot.
