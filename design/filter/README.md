Filter Design
=============

`filterChainDesigns.m` is the main filter chain design file.

`examples` contains examples from other sources, either unchanged or slightly modified.

`deprecated` contains old design and sandbox files which are no longer relevant for
the system implementation, but might still have some illustrative purpose, and are
therefore kept around.
